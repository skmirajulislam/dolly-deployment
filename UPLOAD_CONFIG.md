# Upload Configuration Test

## Current File Size Limits

✅ **Images**: Up to 50MB
✅ **Videos**: Up to 50MB

## Important Notes for Vercel Deployment

⚠️ **Vercel Limitation**: Vercel has a hard limit of **4.5MB** for request bodies in serverless functions, even with our configuration.

## Solutions for 50MB Files:

### Option 1: Use Vercel Pro Plan
- Upgrade to Vercel Pro for higher limits
- Configure `maxDuration` in vercel.json (already done)

### Option 2: Client-Side Direct Upload to Cloudinary
- Implement Cloudinary's signed upload widget
- Upload directly from browser to Cloudinary
- Bypass Vercel's serverless function limits

### Current Configuration:
```json
// vercel.json
{
  "functions": {
    "app/api/upload/route.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 120
    }
  }
}
```

```typescript
// app/api/upload/route.ts
const maxImageSize = 50 * 1024 * 1024; // 50MB for high-res images
const maxVideoSize = 50 * 1024 * 1024; // 50MB for videos
```

## Testing
1. Build passes successfully ✅
2. Error messages updated for 50MB ✅
3. Timeout increased to 120 seconds ✅

## Recommendation
For production with large files, consider implementing Cloudinary's direct upload to avoid Vercel's limitations.
